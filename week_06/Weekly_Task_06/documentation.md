- Added a CSS trandsition so when tiles appear, they fade in smoothly rather than popping in instantly, I found this part challenging but it worked out in th end


## Reflection
- I enjoyed using the concept of Batik and transforming it into a digital animation
- I liked the fade in animation of the tiles
- I found balancing the opacity and transtition timing quite challenging (the fade in)
- To improve maybe make the design more responsive 
- Add customixation and try out different patterns and shapes
