 - Integrates interaction and motion into the fidget board
 - When switch is pressed, the 'fidget board' shakes 
 - This can be turned off when clicked again
 - Improved the visual of the checkboxes
 
 ## Reflection
 Overall, this project was very fun to make and experiment. I ran into some challenges when styling inputs and making sure the interactions responded correctly. 
 
 If I were to continue developing it, I would add more fidget-style interactions and experiment with color, since the current design feels a bit visually bland. I would also focus more on balancing visual styling with interactivity to make the experience more engaging overall.
